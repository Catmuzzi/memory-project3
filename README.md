#Memory Game
A simple game of memory.  Match the letters behind the 3.5" floppy 'cards.'  Try to beat your time and number of moves!

##How to Play
Click on a diskette card to start the game.  The number of moves and time will be tracked.  The game is over when all matches are made.  If you want to start over in the middle of the game, click the restart button.

###Known Quirks
The timer is not an official stopwatch minutes/seconds counter.
The last card does not flip over -- but the player knows the last match is made.
